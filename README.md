# CIS046-3: Software For Enterprise - Assignment 1

[cite\_start]This repository contains the source code and supporting materials for Assignment 1 of the CIS046-3 Software For Enterprise unit[cite: 4]. [cite\_start]The project is an artifact-based submission where a software application has been developed to serve as the foundation for a video presentation[cite: 4].

[cite\_start]The primary submission is a 10-minute video that demonstrates the working application and critically discusses its implementation in the context of four key computer science themes[cite: 4, 9].

## Assignment Overview

[cite\_start]This assignment requires the development of a software application in a mainstream programming language[cite: 7]. [cite\_start]The codebase must be sufficiently complex to support a meaningful discussion[cite: 7]. [cite\_start]The final submission is a video of a maximum of 10 minutes[cite: 4, 9].

[cite\_start]The core task is to reflect on and discuss the following four themes, using the developed code as a practical context[cite: 7, 26]:

  * [cite\_start]Version Control [cite: 9]
  * [cite\_start]Event-Driven Programming [cite: 9]
  * [cite\_start]Interoperability [cite: 9]
  * [cite\_start]Virtual Identity [cite: 9]

[cite\_start]This assignment is weighted at **60%** of the total unit mark[cite: 4]. [cite\_start]The submission deadline is **before 10 a.m. on 05/12/2025**[cite: 3].

## The Four Key Themes

[cite\_start]The video presentation begins with a short demonstration of the working system, followed by a substantive discussion of the four themes in the context of this codebase[cite: 26].

#### 1\. Version Control

> *[In this section, add a brief summary of how your repository's structure, commit history, and branching strategy (if any) demonstrate your understanding of version control for managing code, ensuring modularity, and aiding collaboration.]*

#### 2\. Event-Driven Programming

> *[In this section, add a brief summary identifying the key events within your application. Explain what generates them and what mechanisms (e.g., listeners, handlers) are in place to manage them.]*

#### 3\. Interoperability

> *[In this section, add a brief summary explaining how your application interoperates with external code, APIs, or services. Mention the protocols or data formats used to achieve this communication.]*

#### 4\. Virtual Identity

> *[In this section, add a brief summary of how your application handles virtual identity. Discuss the authentication mechanisms, use of passwords, or cookies implemented to secure the application.]*

## About This Implementation

  * **Project Description**: `[Provide a 2-3 sentence description of what your application does. [cite_start]For example: "This is a simple game application built using the 'Banana' API where the user has to guess..."]` [cite: 7]
  * [cite\_start]**Programming Language(s)**: `[e.g., JavaScript, Java, PHP]` [cite: 7]
  * **Key Frameworks/Libraries/APIs**: `[e.g., Node.js, React, Banana API, etc. List any major external tools you used.]`

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to get the application running locally.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# List any software or tools that need to be installed beforehand.
# e.g., Java JDK 11, Node.js v18, etc.
```

### Installation & Execution

```bash
# Provide step-by-step commands to install dependencies and run the application.
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]

# 2. Navigate to the project directory
cd [PROJECT_DIRECTORY]

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Run the application
npm start
```

## Deliverables & Supporting Evidence

  * [cite\_start]**Source Code**: The full source code for the working implementation is included in this repository[cite: 10].
  * **Video Presentation**: A link to the final 10-minute video presentation.
      * **Link**: `[INSERT THE URL TO YOUR VIDEO HERE]`
  * **Additional Materials**:
      * [cite\_start]`[e.g., A transcript of the video is available in 'transcript.txt']` [cite: 12]
      * [cite\_start]`[e.g., Design documentation can be found in the '/docs' folder.]` [cite: 12]

## Code Provenance & Acknowledgements

[cite\_start]While this is an individual assignment, the use of external code and seeking help is permitted and encouraged, provided it is fully acknowledged[cite: 15, 33]. [cite\_start]Any code that does not originate from me has been clearly marked and referenced within the source code comments[cite: 11, 34, 37]. [cite\_start]The use of generative AI was permitted for code generation but not for the video production[cite: 73].

The following resources were used:

  * **Code from URL**: `[e.g., Stack Overflow - link to the specific question]`
  * [cite\_start]**Third-Party Library**: `[e.g., 'Banana' API - https://marcconrad.com/uob/banana/doc.php]` [cite: 7]
  * [cite\_start]**Generative AI**: `[e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT was used to generate the function 'functionName' in 'file.js']` [cite: 33]
  * [cite\_start]**Help from Peer**: `[e.g., John Doe helped me debug the authentication logic.]` [cite: 33]
